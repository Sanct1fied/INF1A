Questions to get to know people 
Are you from the UK? #because i think there will be a 50/50 change they are international vs from the UK
Have you studied Computer Science OR Discrete Maths before? #I included an OR here because i think that some people might not have done comp sci specifically but still have studied discrete maths in furthur maths which is very important in comp sci
Have you played sports (competitively) in the past? #this is a question not related to comp sci and might be a bit of a curveball but is still interesting to know about a person (and i am sporty)
